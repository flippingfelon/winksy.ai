# ✅ Client Names Fixed for Calendar Sync!

## 🎉 What I Fixed

Your calendar is syncing successfully, but client names weren't showing up. Here's what I did:

### 1. **Show Event Titles as Client Names**
- Google Calendar event titles now appear as the "client name"
- For example: "Haircut with Sarah" will show "Haircut with Sarah"
- If there's no title, it shows "No Client Name"

### 2. **Smart Client Matching**
- The system now tries to match event titles to existing clients
- If your event is "Sarah - Lash Appointment" and you have a client named "Sarah", it will auto-link!
- Matching uses the first word in the event title

### 3. **Visual Indicators**
- Imported appointments now have a badge showing where they came from
- Look for the blue badge that says "google" or "ical"
- Easy to tell which appointments are imported vs manually created

### 4. **Combined Notes**
- Event title + description are both saved in the notes field
- You can see full details when you open the appointment

## 🔄 How to See the Changes

### Step 1: Sync Again
To update your existing appointments:

1. Go to **My Appointments** page
2. Find the **Calendar Sync** section (top right)
3. Click the **refresh icon** next to your Google Calendar connection
4. Wait for sync to complete

✅ Your appointments should now show client names!

### Step 2: Check Your Appointments
- Imported appointments will now show the event title as the client name
- You'll see a blue badge indicating "google" next to imported appointments
- Client info from Google Calendar is now visible

## 📝 Tips for Better Client Matching

To help the system automatically link imported appointments to your clients:

### Name Your Calendar Events Like This:

**Good Examples:**
- ✅ "Sarah - Lash Appointment"
- ✅ "Emma Johnson"
- ✅ "Jessica - Volume Lashes"

**Why?** The system matches the **first word** to your client names.

### In Your Winksy Clients List:

Make sure you've added your regular clients:
1. Go to **My Clients**
2. Add your clients with their full names
3. When you sync, events with matching names will auto-link!

## 🎯 What Happens Now?

### Existing Imported Appointments:
- **Already synced?** Sync again to update them with the new logic
- **Client names missing?** They'll now show the event title
- **Have matching clients?** They'll auto-link on next sync

### Future Appointments:
- ✅ Event titles automatically appear as client names
- ✅ Auto-matching with existing clients
- ✅ Full event details in notes
- ✅ Visual badge showing import source

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Standardize Your Event Titles**
In Google Calendar, use a consistent format:
- "FirstName - Service" (e.g., "Emma - Volume Lashes")
- This makes it easier to see who the appointment is with

### 2. **Add Clients to Winksy First**
Before syncing:
1. Add your regular clients to **My Clients**
2. Use their first name exactly as it appears in your calendar
3. Then sync - they'll auto-link!

### 3. **Manual Linking**
If an appointment doesn't auto-link:
1. Click on the appointment
2. Click **Edit** (coming soon!)
3. Manually select the client from dropdown

### 4. **Client Information in Google Calendar**
Include in your event description:
- Phone number
- Email
- Special requests
- This will all show up in the appointment notes!
