## 🎓 Understanding the AI

### How It Sees Eyes:

The AI uses **geometric analysis** of facial landmarks:

1. **Eye Width** = Distance between inner/outer corners
2. **Eye Height** = Distance between top/bottom lids
3. **Height/Width Ratio** = Determines shape
   - > 0.5 = Round
   - < 0.35 = Almond
   - Middle = Check lid visibility for hooded

4. **Eye Distance** = Space between inner corners
   - Compared to face width
   - Categorizes as close/average/wide

5. **Confidence Score** = Based on:
   - Landmark detection quality
   - Face angle (straight-on = higher)
   - Lighting conditions
   - Eye visibility
