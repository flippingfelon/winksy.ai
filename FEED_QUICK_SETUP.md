# 🚀 Quick Feed Setup Guide

## ⚠️ You're seeing this error because the database tables don't exist yet!

Error: **"Posts table not found. Please run the feed database migration."**

---

## ✅ Fix in 3 Steps:

### **Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

### **Step 2: Copy the Migration SQL**
1. Open the file: `create_feed_tables_updated.sql` 
2. Copy **ALL** the contents (the entire file)

**OR** copy this directly:

```sql
-- Just copy everything from create_feed_tables_updated.sql
-- It's about 175 lines of SQL
```

### **Step 3: Run the SQL**
1. Paste the SQL into the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Click **"Run"** (or press Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter)
3. Wait for "Success" message (should take 1-2 seconds)

## ✅ What This Creates:

- ✅ `posts` table (with optional images for tips/tutorials)
- ✅ `post_likes` table
- ✅ `post_comments` table  
- ✅ `user_follows` table
- ✅ All indexes for performance
- ✅ RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- ✅ Triggers for like/comment counts

---

## ✅ Then Create Storage Bucket:

After running the SQL, you also need a storage bucket for images:

1. In Supabase, click **"Storage"** in sidebar
2. Click **"New Bucket"**
3. Name: `feed-images`
4. **✅ Check "Public bucket"**
5. Click **"Create bucket"**

---

## ✅ Test It!

After completing both steps above:

1. Refresh your browser at `/feed/create`
2. Try creating a post
3. Check the browser console - you should see:
   ```
   🚀 Starting post creation...
   📤 Uploading image...
   ✅ Image uploaded successfully
   💾 Creating post in database...
   ✅ Post created successfully
   ✨ Post creation complete!
   ```
