## ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

### Appointments Page Header
- "Connect Calendar" button with purple border
- Connection count badge
- "Last synced: [time]" indicator when calendars are connected

### Calendar Sync Page
- Platform selection (Square, Booksy, GlossGenius, iCal, Other)
- Connection name input
- iCal URL input with validation
- Connected calendars list with:
  - Platform icon and badge
  - Connection name and URL
  - Last sync time and appointment count
  - Sync Now, Pause/Resume, Delete buttons
- Help sections for each platform

---

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

1. **User adds calendar connection**
   - Enters platform, name, and iCal URL
   - Saved to `calendar_connections` table

2. **Manual sync (optional)**
   - User clicks "Sync Now"
   - Calls `/api/calendar/sync`
   - Fetches and parses iCal feed
   - Creates/updates appointments

3. **Automatic sync (hourly)**
   - Vercel cron calls `/api/calendar/auto-sync`
   - Finds connections that need syncing
   - Syncs each connection
   - Updates last_synced_at timestamp

4. **Duplicate prevention**
   - Each appointment tracked by `external_event_id`
   - Updates existing if ID matches
   - Creates new if ID doesn't exist
