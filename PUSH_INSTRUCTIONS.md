# Push to GitHub Instructions

Your code is ready to push! Since you have your Personal Access Token set up, here are the exact commands:

## Option 1: Push with Token (Recommended)

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/chadsloat/winsky/winsky
git push origin main
```

When prompted:
- **Username:** Enter your GitHub username (flippingfelon)
- **Password:** Paste your Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)

## Option 2: Use Token in URL (One-time)

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` and `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual values:

```bash
cd /Users/chadsloat/winsky/winsky
git push https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/flippingfelon/winksy.ai.git main
```

## Option 3: Store Credentials (For Future Use)

To avoid entering credentials every time:

```bash
# Store credentials in macOS Keychain
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

# Then push (enter credentials once)
git push origin main
```

## Current Status

✅ **Your repository has 2 commits ready to push:**
1. Complete Winksy.ai homepage with auth and PWA setup
2. Add deployment guide and GitHub push helper

✅ **Files included:**
- Homepage with beautiful design
- Authentication pages (signin/signup)
- Dashboard with gamification
- PWA configuration
- Supabase schema and setup docs
- Deployment guide

## After Pushing

Once pushed, you can immediately:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (Free & Fast)
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/new
   - Import: `flippingfelon/winksy.ai`
   - Add environment variables from `.env.local`
   - Deploy!

2. **Your app will be live in minutes!**

## Troubleshooting

If you get an authentication error:
- Make sure you're using the Personal Access Token as the password
- The token needs `repo` scope permissions
- Tokens look like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

If you need a new token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select `repo` scope
4. Copy and use as password
