3. Verify your phone number

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

After logging in to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/):

#### Get Account SID & Auth Token

### Step 3: Update `.env.local`

Open your `.env.local` file and update these lines:

```bash
# Twilio SMS Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # ‚Üê Your Account SID
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_32_character_auth_token         # ‚Üê Your Auth Token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890                        # ‚Üê Your Twilio Number

## Important Notes

### Free Trial Limitations
- **Verified Numbers Only**: In trial mode, you can only send SMS to phone numbers you've verified in Twilio
- **Trial Message Prefix**: Messages will include "Sent from your Twilio trial account"
- **Free Credits**: You get $15 in trial credits (enough for ~600 messages)

### To Remove Trial Limitations
1. Upgrade your Twilio account (add billing info)
2. You can then send to any phone number
3. Messages won't have the trial prefix

### Adding Verified Numbers (Free Trial)
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/verified
2. Click "Add New Number"
3. Enter the phone number you want to send to
4. Verify with code

## Troubleshooting

### "SMS not configured" Error

### "Permission to send SMS has not been enabled"
