# 🔧 "Appointment Not Found" Error - Fixed!

## ✅ What I Fixed

The "Appointment not found" error was happening when trying to view appointment details. I've improved the error handling and made the app more robust with imported appointments.

### Changes Made:

1. **Better Error Logging**
   - Now logs detailed error information to console
   - Helps debug issues more easily
   - Shows exactly what went wrong

2. **User Authentication Check**
   - Verifies user is logged in before fetching
   - Prevents errors when user session is loading
   - Better handling of authentication state

3. **Improved Client Name Handling**
   - Uses event title when no client is linked
   - Works with imported appointments that don't have clients
   - Better SMS message previews

4. **Better SMS Error Messages**
   - Clear message when client phone is missing
   - Explains that imported appointments don't have contact info
   - Helps you understand why SMS won't work

## 🔍 Why This Error Happens

### Common Causes:

1. **User Not Logged In Yet**
   - Page loads before authentication completes
   - **Fix**: Wait for page to fully load

2. **Wrong Appointment ID**
   - Clicking an old/broken link
   - **Fix**: Go back to appointments list and click again

3. **Permission Issue**
   - Trying to view someone else's appointment
   - **Fix**: Make sure you're viewing your own appointments

4. **Database Connection Issue**
   - Temporary network problem
   - **Fix**: Refresh the page

## 🎯 How to Troubleshoot

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

1. Open **DevTools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Try clicking the appointment again
4. Look for error messages

**What to Look For:**
- `User not logged in` → Wait for page to load completely
- `Error code: PGRST116` → Appointment doesn't exist or no permission
- `Error fetching appointment` → Database/network issue

### Step 2: Verify You're Logged In

1. Check if you see your profile name in the header
2. If not logged in, click **Sign In**
3. Once logged in, try viewing the appointment again

### Step 3: Go Back to Appointments List

1. Click **← Back to Appointments** (or go to My Appointments)
2. Find the appointment in the list
3. Click it again to view details

### Step 4: Check Appointment Exists

1. Go to **My Appointments**
2. Look for the appointment in your list
3. If you can't find it, it might have been deleted

## 🐛 Debug Mode

If you're still having issues, here's how to get detailed error info:

### Open Browser Console (F12):

When you click an appointment and get the error, look for these messages:

```
Error fetching appointment: [details here]
Error code: [code]
Error details: [details]
Error hint: [hint]
```

**Common Error Codes:**

| Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| `PGRST116` | Row not found | Appointment doesn't exist or wrong ID |
| `42501` | Permission denied | Not your appointment or RLS issue |
| `42P01` | Table doesn't exist | Database migration needed |
| Network error | Can't reach database | Check internet connection |

## 🔐 For Imported Appointments

Imported appointments from Google Calendar work fine now! But note:

### ✅ What Works:
- View appointment details
- See event title as client name
- Mark as complete/cancelled
- View appointment date/time
- See full event notes

### ⚠️ What Doesn't Work (Yet):
- **Send SMS** - No client phone number
  - Imported events don't include contact info
  - **Solution**: Manually link to a client or add contact info
- **Client profile link** - No linked client
  - **Solution**: Create client in "My Clients" with matching name

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Link Imported Appointments to Clients

To enable SMS for imported appointments:

1. Go to **My Clients**
2. Add the client with their phone number
3. Sync calendar again
4. System will auto-link appointments with matching names

### 2. Add Client Info to Calendar Events

In Google Calendar, add to event description:
```
Client: Sarah Johnson
Phone: (555) 123-4567
Email: sarah@email.com
```

Then the info shows up in appointment notes!

### 3. Use Consistent Event Titles

Format your Google Calendar events like:
- "Sarah - Volume Lashes"
- "Emma Johnson - Fill"
- "Jessica - Classic Set"

This helps with auto-matching!
