# 🔧 Error Fix Guide: "Error fetching posts"

## The Issue

You're seeing this error in the console:
```
Error fetching posts: {}
```

**What it means:** The Lash Feed database tables haven't been created yet.

**Good news:** This is expected on first run! It's easy to fix. ✅

## 🎯 The Solution (3 Minutes)

### Quick Fix: Run the Database Migration

The Lash Feed needs 4 database tables to work. Here's how to create them:

#### **Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your project
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

2. **Run the Migration:**
   - Open the file: `create_feed_tables.sql` (in your project root)
   - Copy ALL the contents
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" (or Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
   - Wait for "Success. No rows returned"

3. **Create Storage Bucket:**
   - Go to "Storage" in Supabase Dashboard
   - Click "Create a new bucket"
   - Name: `feed-images`
   - **Important:** Set to **Public**
   - Click "Create bucket"

4. **Test:**
   - Go back to `/feed` in your app
   - Refresh the page (Cmd/Ctrl + R)
   - Error should be gone! 🎉

#### **Method 2: Quick Setup Script**

Run this in your terminal:
```bash
./setup-feed-now.sh
```

This script will:
- Show you the SQL to copy
- Give you step-by-step instructions
- (macOS only) Copy SQL to your clipboard

## 🔍 What's Happening

### Why You See the Error

When you visit `/feed` for the first time, the app tries to query the `posts` table. But that table doesn't exist yet! The app now detects this and shows you a helpful setup banner.

### What Gets Fixed

After running the migration, you'll have:

1. **Database Tables:**
   - `posts` - Store feed posts
   - `post_likes` - Track likes
   - `post_comments` - Store comments
   - `user_follows` - Follow relationships

2. **Security:**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Users can only edit their own content
   - Safe and secure by default

3. **Performance:**
   - Indexes for fast queries
   - Automatic counters for likes/comments
   - Optimized for scale

4. **Storage:**
   - `feed-images` bucket for photo uploads
   - Public access for displaying images

## 📸 After Setup: How to Use

### 1. View the Feed
- Click the **Camera icon** (📷) in the top-right header
- Or go to `/feed`

### 2. Create Your First Post
- Click the **floating + button** (bottom-right)
- Upload a photo (drag or click)
- Write a caption
- Select post type
- Optional: Tag a lash map
- Click "Post"
- Earn 100 points! 🎉

### 3. Interact
- Like posts with the ❤️ button
- Switch between filter tabs
- Share posts with the ↗️ button

---

## ✅ Verification

### Check if Setup Worked

**Option 1: Visit the Feed**
- Go to `/feed`
- You should see either:
  - Empty state: "No posts yet"
  - OR your posts if you created any

**Option 2: Run SQL Check**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('posts', 'post_likes', 'post_comments', 'user_follows');
```

Should return 4 rows if setup is complete.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing the error?

#### Error: "relation 'posts' does not exist"
**Fix:** The SQL migration didn't run successfully
- Try running the SQL again
- Make sure you copied ALL the SQL
- Check for error messages in Supabase

#### Error: "Storage bucket not found"
**Fix:** Create the storage bucket
- Go to Supabase → Storage
- Create bucket: `feed-images`
- Set to Public

#### Error: "permission denied"
**Fix:** RLS policies not created
- The migration should create these automatically
- Try running the migration again

#### Can't upload images
**Check:**
- Is the `feed-images` bucket created?
- Is it set to Public?
- Is the image under 10MB?
- Is it a valid image file (JPG, PNG, etc.)?

#### Page shows setup banner but tables exist
**Fix:**
- Clear browser cache
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for specific error
