## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch calendar feed"

**Problem**: The iCal URL is incorrect or expired

**Solutions**:
- Double-check the URL is correct
- Make sure it starts with `https://` (not `webcal://`)
- The URL might have expired - get a new one from your platform
- Check if your booking platform requires authentication

### "No appointments imported"

**Problem**: The calendar is empty or appointments are in the past

**Solutions**:
- Make sure you have upcoming appointments in your external calendar
- Past appointments are not imported by default
- Check the date range in your external calendar settings

### Appointments are duplicated

**Problem**: Same appointment imported twice

**Solutions**:
- This shouldn't happen - the system tracks external event IDs
- If you see duplicates, one might be manually created
- Check the appointment details - imported ones have "Import Source" tag

### Calendar not syncing automatically

**Problem**: Auto-sync cron job not running

**Solutions**:
- Auto-sync requires deployment to Vercel with the `vercel.json` configuration
- In development, you need to manually click "Sync Now"
- Check Vercel dashboard for cron job logs

---

## üîê Security

- iCal feed URLs should be kept private (they contain access tokens)
- URLs are stored securely in the database
- Only you can see your calendar connections
- In production, consider encrypting the `connection_url` field

---

## üé® Customization

### Change Auto-Sync Frequency

Edit `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/calendar/auto-sync",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *"  // Every hour (default)
      // "schedule": "*/30 * * * *"  // Every 30 minutes
      // "schedule": "0 */2 * * *"  // Every 2 hours
    }
  ]
}
```

Cron format: `minute hour day month weekday`

### Manual Sync via API

You can trigger a sync manually:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/calendar/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"connectionId": "your-connection-id"}'
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I connect multiple calendars?**  
A: Yes! You can connect as many calendars as you want.

**Q: Will it sync past appointments?**  
A: Currently no, only future appointments are synced. This is by design to avoid cluttering your calendar.

**Q: Can I sync TO external calendars (two-way)?**  
A: Not yet. Currently it's import-only. Two-way sync is planned for a future update.

**Q: What happens if I delete a connection?**  
A: The connection is removed, but previously imported appointments remain in your system.

**Q: Do I need to re-connect if the URL changes?**  
A: Yes, if your platform generates a new feed URL, you'll need to update it in the settings.

**Q: Can clients see which platform the appointment came from?**  
A: No, this is only visible to you in the admin interface.
